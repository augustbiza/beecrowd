# COORDINATES OF A POINT
Write an algorithm that reads two floating values (x and y), which should represent the coordinates of a point in a plane. Next, determine which quadrant the point belongs, or if you are at one of the Cartesian axes or the origin (x = y = 0).  
If the point is at the origin, write the message "Origem".  
If the point is at X axis write "Eixo X", else if the point is at Y axis write "Eixo Y".
### Input
The input contains the coordinates of a point.
### Output
The output should display the quadrant in which the point is.
